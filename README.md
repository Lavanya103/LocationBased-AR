These three, basic projects are used for our Location Based Augmented Reality on the Web, using AR.js v2.0.x.

* dynamic-places: places are added with remote APIs fetch, using Foursquare APIs. Need configuration (client id and client secret)

* static-on-html: places are added using a static array via script: you have to manually insert valid gps coordinates in order to see places near you

*  only-html: add one (ore more) place using only a single HTML file. Needs manual addition of valid coordinates.
